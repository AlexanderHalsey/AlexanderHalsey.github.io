    <p i18n class="text-xl mb-8">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p i18n class="mb-8">
      You guessed itâ€”I like Rubik's cubes. But what Iâ€™m even more passionate about is coding! Iâ€™m a
      full-stack web developer with a love for building beautiful and functional web applications.
    </p>
    <p i18n class="mb-8">
      My journey into programming began as a hobby in 2020. I started with little knowledge and a
      lot of curiosity. Not long after, I had the opportunity to volunteer my newly-acquired skills
      to create a donation management system for a Buddhist institute. It was a challenging
      experience filled with mistakes, but each one became a stepping stone for growth.
    </p>
    <p i18n class="mb-8">
      Those early days taught me that making mistakes isnâ€™t just part of the processâ€”itâ€™s how we
      improve. Over time, my passion for problem-solving and creativity in coding has only grown
      stronger, driving me to constantly learn, experiment, and refine my craft.
    </p>
    <p i18n class="mb-8">
      When Iâ€™m not coding or solving puzzles, Iâ€™m usually exploring new technologies or thinking up
      creative ways to make the web a better place. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
