      <p i18n class="mb-6">
        You guessed itâ€”I like Rubik's cubes. But what Iâ€™m even more passionate about is coding! Iâ€™m
        a full-stack web developer with a love for building beautiful and functional web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p i18n class="mb-6">
        My journey into programming began as a hobby in 2020. I started with little knowledge and a
        lot of curiosity. Not long after, I had the opportunity to volunteer my newly-acquired
        skills to create a donation management system for a Buddhist institute. It was a challenging
        experience filled with mistakes, but each one became a stepping stone for growth.
      </p>
      <p i18n class="mb-6">
        Those early days taught me that making mistakes isnâ€™t just part of the processâ€”itâ€™s how we
        improve. Over time, my passion for problem-solving and creativity in coding has only grown
        stronger, driving me to constantly learn, experiment, and refine my craft.
      </p>
      <p i18n>
        When Iâ€™m not coding or solving puzzles, Iâ€™m usually exploring new technologies or thinking
        up creative ways to make the web a better place. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
